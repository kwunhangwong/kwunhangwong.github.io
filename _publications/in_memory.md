title: "In-memory and In-Sensor Reservoir Computing with Memristive Devices"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'Reservoir computing enables real-time edge learning thanks to its brain-inspired dynamic system with massive training complexity reduction. From this perspective, we survey recent advancements in in-memory/in-sensor reservoir computing, including algorithm designs, material and device development, and downstream applications in classification and regression problems, and discuss challenges and opportunities ahead in this emerging field.'
