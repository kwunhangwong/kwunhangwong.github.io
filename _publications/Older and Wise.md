title: "Older and Wise: The Marriage of Device Aging and Intellectual Property Protection of DNNs"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Previous approaches to securing DNNs typically require expensive circuit redesign, resulting in additional overheads such as increased area, energy consumption, and latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel hardware-software co-design for DNN protection that leverages the inherent aging characteristics of circuits to provide effect protection.'
