title: "Resistive memory-based zero-shot liquid state machine for multimodal event data learning"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'Replicating the human brain in neuromorphic hardware presents both hardware and software challenges. We propose a hardware–software co-design on a 40 nm 256 kB in-memory computing macro that physically integrates a fixed and random liquid state machine SNN encoder with trainable artificial neural network projections. We showcase the zero-shot learning of multimodal events on the N-MNIST and N-TIDIGITS datasets, including visual and audio data association, as well as neural and visual data alignment for brain–machine interfaces.'
