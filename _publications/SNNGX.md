title: "SNNGX: Securing Spiking Neural Networks with Genetic XOR Encryption on RRAM-based Neuromorphic Accelerator"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'There is a considerable risk from malicious attempts to extract white-box information (i.e., weights) from Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic accelerator since attackers could exploit well-trained SNNs from emerging NVM cells for profit, as well as causing white-box adversarial concerns. In this paper, we present a novel secure software-hardware co-designed RRAM-based neuromorphic accelerator for protecting the IP of SNNs.'
