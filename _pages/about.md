Hi there, welcome to my site! I'm Edwin, who was born at the millennial year AD2000 (the lunar year of Dragon🐉) in Hong Kong. I am a second year PhD student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering from HKU [@IMSC Lab](https://zhongruiwang.github.io/), [@CVMI Lab](https://cvmi.hku.hk) and serve as a research assistant at AI Chip Centre for Emerging Smart Systems (ACCESS). My research work on neuromorphic computing is co-supervised by Prof. Zhongrui Wang (Hardware) and Prof. Xiaojuan Qi (Software). 

My dream is to become a leading AI scientist that drives the 3rd thousand year of civilization and revolutionizes human history. I am actively looking for overseas research opportunities for collaboration currently!
